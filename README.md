# Hey, I'm Jesspher 👋

I like building tools that interest me. Mainly: **GIS + woodworking** — from QGIS/JOSM automation for OpenStreetMap to CNC/woodworking workflows for my brand **JessWoodWorks**.

- 🗺️ GIS: QGIS, JOSM, OpenStreetMap  
- 🐍 Code: Python (PyQGIS, geopandas)  
- 🧰 Making: SketchUp, CNC, design-for-fabrication  
- 🌎 Based in Los Angeles County (Palmdale, CA)
